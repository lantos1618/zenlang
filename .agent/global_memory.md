# Zen Language Project Global Memory

## Project State
- Language Version: 1.0
- Implementation: ~75-80% complete
- Test Pass Rate: 99% (6 tests failing)
- Self-Hosting Progress: Lexer 90%, Parser 25%

## Key Decisions
- Loop syntax: Moving to functional style only
- No keywords philosophy maintained
- Pattern matching with `?` operator
- Explicit error handling with Result<T,E>

## Technical Notes
- LLVM backend complete
- 27 files need loop syntax updates
- Stdlib mostly complete, missing net/mem modules
- 120 compiler warnings to clean up

## Current Focus
- Achieving self-hosting capability
- Fixing loop syntax consistency
- Completing parser implementation
