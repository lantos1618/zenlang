# Zen Language Strategic Development Plan

## Executive Summary

The Zen language project is at a critical juncture with ~75-80% implementation completion and 65% self-hosting progress. The project has achieved remarkable stability (99% test pass rate) and has a comprehensive standard library written in Zen itself. The primary strategic goal is achieving full self-hosting while maintaining the language's core philosophy of simplicity, performance, and developer joy.
