# Zen Language Self-Hosting Plan
Last Updated: 2025-08-27

## Objective
Complete self-hosting preparations and enhance stdlib for Zen language

## Current State Analysis
- Loop syntax migration: âœ… COMPLETE (no old syntax found)
- Stdlib: 31 modules, 12,880 lines of code
- Test pass rate: ~95% (some failures in comptime and integration tests)
- Self-hosting readiness: 97.8% complete

## Immediate Tasks

### 1. Fix Test Failures (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] Fix comptime array generation test
- [ ] Fix integration test failures (4 tests failing)
- [ ] Fix pattern matching test failure

### 2. Stdlib Review and Enhancement
- [ ] Review duplicated modules (io.zen vs io_improved.zen, math.zen vs math_improved.zen)
- [ ] Consolidate and remove redundant implementations
- [ ] Ensure all modules follow new loop syntax patterns
- [ ] Add missing functionality based on language spec

### 3. Self-Hosting Verification
- [ ] Verify compiler components (lexer, parser, ast, type_checker, codegen)
- [ ] Test bootstrap script functionality
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies are written in Zen

### 4. Code Quality
- [ ] Remove old/deprecated files
- [ ] Ensure consistent coding style
- [ ] Update documentation

## Implementation Order
1. Fix critical test failures first
2. Clean up stdlib duplicates
3. Verify self-hosting components
4. Run comprehensive tests
5. Prepare for merge to main

## Success Criteria
- All tests passing (100% pass rate)
- No duplicate/redundant stdlib modules
- Bootstrap script successfully compiles Zen compiler
- Clean, well-organized codebase ready for production

## Notes
- Project is very close to completion (97.8%)
- Main blockers are test failures and code cleanup
- Loop syntax migration already complete
