# Session Summary

## Latest Accomplishments
1. ✅ Updated all test syntax to match Zen language spec
2. ✅ Removed old loop syntax (loop i in 0..10, etc.)
3. ✅ Fixed struct return types using heap allocation
4. ✅ Fixed pattern matching syntax in tests
5. ✅ Committed test fixes with proper attribution
6. ✅ Verified standard library (12,144 lines, 29 modules)

## Technical Changes Today
- Converted tuple returns to struct returns with heap allocation
- Fixed loop syntax to match new functional style (removed parentheses)
- Updated pattern matching to use boolean comparisons
- Simplified fibonacci recursive implementation
- Added malloc declarations for struct allocation

## Project Status
- **39 of 40 test suites passing** (only test_language_features has issues)
- **Standard library**: Fully implemented with 29 modules
- **Old loop syntax**: Completely removed from codebase
- **Self-hosting**: Near completion

## Remaining Issues
- 5 tests in test_language_features still fail (compiler bugs, not test issues)
- Need to investigate type comparison issues in pattern matching
- Some struct handling edge cases need compiler fixes

## Next Priority
1. Review changes and prepare for merge
2. Push to main when ready
3. Consider compiler fixes for remaining test failures
