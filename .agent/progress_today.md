# Progress Report - August 28, 2025

## Summary
Major progress on loop syntax simplification and self-hosted parser development. Successfully removed complex loop variants in favor of simple, composable primitives aligned with Zen's minimal keyword philosophy.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Loop Syntax Simplification ✅
- **Removed**: `loop i in 0..10`, `loop item in items`, `loop i in 1..=5` 
- **Kept**: `loop condition { }` and `loop { }` only
- **Added**: Functional patterns: `range(0,10).loop(|i| {})`
- Updated all example files and tests to new syntax

### 2. Standard Library Enhancements
- **stdlib/core.zen**: Added Range.loop() method and helper functions
- **stdlib/iterator.zen**: New comprehensive iterator module with functional patterns
- **stdlib/parser.zen**: Significantly enhanced with expression parsing hierarchy

### 3. Self-Hosted Parser Progress (~25% Complete)
- Implemented complete expression parsing with proper precedence
- Added statement parsing (variables, return, loop, if, blocks)
- Created declaration parsing (functions, structs, external functions)
- Structured parser with entry point parser_parse_program()

## Files Modified
- 7 example files updated (loops.zen, 04_loops.zen, comptime.zen, functional_loops.zen, etc.)
- 3 stdlib files enhanced (core.zen, iterator.zen, parser.zen)
- 1 test file fixed (test_language_features.rs)
- 2 documentation files created

## Commits Made
1. Refactored loop syntax removing range/iterator variants
2. Added iterator module to standard library  
3. Added session documentation
4. Enhanced self-hosted parser with expression parsing

## Test Status
- Loop tests: ✅ Passing
- Overall: ~99% pass rate
- Parser ready for array access implementation

## Impact on Self-Hosting
The simplified loop syntax makes the self-hosted compiler easier to implement. Parser now has proper structure for parsing Zen code, bringing us closer to self-hosting capability.

## Next Steps
1. Implement array access in parser
2. Complete token handling in parser
3. Fix remaining test failures
4. Continue standard library development
