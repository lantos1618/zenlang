# Zen Language Progress Report - 2025-08-27

## Session Summary
Significant progress made on parser robustness and standard library support. Fixed critical parsing issues that were blocking stdlib vector tests.

## Major Accomplishments

### Parser Enhancements
1. **Generic Struct Literals** ✅
   - Added support for `Vec<T> { ... }` syntax
   - Parser now properly handles type parameters before struct literals

2. **Member Field Assignments** ✅
   - Implemented `vec.len = value` parsing
   - Uses PointerAssignment AST node for field updates

3. **Array Indexing Chain** ✅
   - Full support for `vec.data[index]` expressions
   - Chained operations: member access → array index → function calls

4. **Block Expressions** ✅
   - Added Block variant to Expression enum
   - Pattern matching arms can now use block syntax

5. **Operator Improvements** ✅
   - Fixed `&&` operator tokenization
   - Properly distinguishes between `&` (symbol) and `&&` (operator)

6. **External Function Parsing** ✅
   - Allows optional parameter names in extern declarations
   - Supports both `(i64, i64)` and `(size: i64, count: i64)` syntax

## Test Results
- **Before**: 4 failing stdlib vector tests
- **After**: 9/10 tests passing (90% pass rate)
- **Overall Test Suite**: ~98% pass rate

## Technical Details

### AST Changes
- Added `Expression::Block(Vec<Statement>)`
- Enhanced pattern matching to handle boolean literals

### Parser Modifications
- Expression parser now handles postfix operations in a loop
- Statement parser detects member assignments via lookahead
- Pattern parser recognizes `true`/`false` as literal patterns

### Lexer Updates
- Special handling for `&&` and `||` operators
- Prevents incorrect tokenization as separate symbols

## Remaining Issues
1. One vector test still failing (complex expression statements)
2. Block expressions currently evaluate to void (need value semantics)

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Update .agent documentation
2. Complete self-hosted lexer implementation
3. Complete self-hosted parser implementation  
4. Implement behaviors/traits system
5. Implement UFCS
6. Implement async/await with Task<T>

## Code Quality
- Clean separation of concerns maintained
- Minimal impact on existing functionality
- All changes properly tested

## Statistics
- Files Modified: 10
- Lines Added: ~350
- Lines Removed: ~70
- Commit Count: 1

## Notes
- Parser is now significantly more robust
- Can handle real-world Zen code patterns
- Foundation laid for self-hosting milestone
